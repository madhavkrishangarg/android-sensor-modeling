This app collects data from the smartphone's accelerometers and displays the device's orientation in real-time using three angles. Additionally, it stores orientation data over time and presents its history in graphical form. The app also supports exporting this history to a text file for time series prediction and analysis.
Python script demonstrates the use of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling for predicting the next 100 values of smartphone orientation angles (x, y, z). The script performs ARIMA modeling separately for each angle and plots the predicted values against the actual values.
